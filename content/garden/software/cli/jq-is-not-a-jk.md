# jq is not a jk!

I have this bad habit if thinking I already know something.
And because of that I created this digital garden -- to knock me down a peg
and get rid of my hubris.

This applies to what I knew about `jq`. I thought `jq` was just a simple tool for selecting data in JSON form.
I was wrong. Not only does it select data, but it can do maps, filters, and some form of reduce as well!
You can also create JSON from newline-delimited inputs! Basically if you need to work with JSON quickly, `jq` has got you covered.

I guess the larger lesson here is, **learn your tools deeply**.
I mean by Pareto Principle, you'll only be using 20% of it 80% of the time, but at least you have an idea of its capabilities when it comes to that 20% of the time that you need the remaining 80% of the features.
